# TypeScript study

This is my first time of learning TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that compile as a JavaScript file

## How it works

### Note:

> TypeScript does not run on the browser

```tsc <filename>```

You need to run this command to compile as a JavaScript file, to get executed on the browser
